        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This recipe will teach you to make a healthy alterative to the take-out classic. Great for storing in the freezer for later as well.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tsp oil (peanut or canola)</li>
            <li>2 garlic clove, minced</li>
            <li>1 inch fresh ginger, peeled and minced</li>
            <li>½ sweet onion, sliced</li>
            <li>1 celery stalk, sliced</li>
            <li>2 carrots, sliced into matchsticks</li>
            <li>½ red pepper, sliced</li>
            <li>½ lb cabbage, sliced thin</li>
            <li>¼ lb bean sprouts</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp rice vinegar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tsp white sugar</li>
            <li>18-20 large (5 inch) Egg Roll Wrappers</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp oil (or cooking spray), for greasing the pan and brushing the rolls before baking</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <h5>For the Filling</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large wok or frying pan.</li>
            <li>Add ginger and garlic, and sauté until fragrant, 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add onion, celery, carrots, and red pepper, and sauté 1-2 minutes, until the onions begin to soften.</li>
            <li>Add sliced cabbage, bean sprouts, vinegar, soy, and sugar. Toss well and continue to sauté for 1-2 minutes, until the cabbage begins to soften.</li>
            <li>Remove the filling from the heat and let cool slightly before filling egg rolls.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>For the rolls</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450F.</li>
            <li>Place one egg roll wrapper on the counter with a point facing you.</li>
            <li>Spread 1 Tbsp of filling in a line, slightly below center of the wrapper.</li>
            <li>Start by rolling the bottom corner over the filling, tightly, until you reach just above half of the wrapper. Then, fold in the two side corners. Lightly brush the final corner with some water to help it stick better, and finish rolling up the rolls away from you.</li>
            <li>Place, seam-side down, on a greased baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Continue with the remaining wrappers and filling.</li>
            <li>Brush with oil or spray with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Bake for 20-25 minutes, until golden and crisp.</li>
        </ol>
