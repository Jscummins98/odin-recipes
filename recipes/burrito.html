        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups cooked rice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
            <li>2 limes, juiced</li>
            <li>1/2 medium onion, diced</li>
            <li>3 to 4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil (or olive oil)</li>
            <li>1 (15-ounce) can black beans (or pinto beans), drained</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon hot sauce, or to taste</li>
            <li>Pinch salt, to taste, optional</li>
            <li>4 (10-inch) large tortillas</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large microwave-safe bowl, toss together cooked rice and fresh chopped cilantro, and drizzle with the lime juice. Heat in the microwave or on the stove just until hot, and give it a quick stir. </li>
            <li>In a separate large skillet, saut√© the onion in vegetable oil or olive oil for 5 minutes, or until the onion is soft. Add the garlic and cook another minute.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low, add the black beans or pinto beans, and season with the chili powder, cumin, and hot sauce, stirring to combine. You can add a bit of salt if you'd like, but you shouldn't need too much with all the other seasonings. Allow the beans to cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Spoon the cilantro-lime rice and the black bean mixture onto lightly warmed flour tortillas, and add any additional toppings you want.</li>
            <li>Wrap the burritos: Fold the short ends in, then fold one long side over the filling and gently push to ensure the fold is tight before rolling up the remainder of the burrito.</li>
            <li>Cut in half, and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
